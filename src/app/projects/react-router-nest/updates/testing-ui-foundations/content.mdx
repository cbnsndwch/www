Quality assurance is now baked into the project with a comprehensive testing suite for the NestJS + React Router 7 integration. This includes setup for unit and integration tests with coverage reporting. 

On the frontend, we've laid the groundwork for our homepage with descriptive metadata, new icon sets, and a refined entry point.

## Testing Stack

- **Unit Testing**: Focused tests for NestJS controllers and services.
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end tests for critical routing and SSR paths.
- **Coverage Reporting**: Detailed insights into test effectiveness.
