We've overhauled our Docker strategy to implement a more efficient two-stage build approach. This significantly reduces image sizes and leverages layer caching more effectively. 

Additionally, we've enabled `cancel-in-progress` for our GitHub workflows, ensuring that stale CI runs don't consume unnecessary resources when new commits are pushed.

## Key Improvements

- **Two-Stage Docker Builds**: Optimized images for production deployment.
- **Improved Caching**: Faster build times by leveraging Docker layer caching and PNPM store cache.
- **CI Resource Management**: Automated cancellation of redundant workflow runs.
