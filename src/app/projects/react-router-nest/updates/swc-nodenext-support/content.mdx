To keep our builds fast and our environment modern, we've integrated **SWC** for TypeScript compilation and updated our configurations to support `NodeNext`.

This shift reduces cold-start times and improves type resolution in our monorepo setup. We've also bumped **Turbo** to ensure our task execution remains efficient as the project grows.

## Highlights

- **SWC Integration**: Replaced standard TypeScript compiler with SWC for significantly faster transpilation.
- **NodeNext Resolution**: Updated `tsconfig` for modern module resolution patterns.
- **Turbo Bump**: Upgraded to the latest version of Turborepo for better caching and execution.
