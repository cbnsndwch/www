The initial launch of the project! We established the core monorepo structure using **PNPM Workspaces** and **Turbo**.

The first milestone focused on a successful custom server integration where NestJS handles the heavy lifting on the backend while serving as the SSR host for React Router 7. We started with an **SWC-based build system** from day one to ensure a high-performance developer experience.

## Primary Milestones

- **Monorepo Setup**: Efficient management of `apps` and `libs` with PNPM.
- **Custom Server Integration**: Bridging NestJS with React Router 7 server-side rendering.
- **High Performance Build**: Initial integration of SWC for rapid development cycles.
