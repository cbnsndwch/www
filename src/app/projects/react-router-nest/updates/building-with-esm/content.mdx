};

The project has been transitioned to use native ECMAScript Modules (ESM). This change involves updating the `package.json` with `"type": "module"`, adding `.js` extensions to imports for ESM compatibility, and configuring SWC for NodeNext support.

## Why ESM?

- **Modern Standards**: ESM is the official standard for JavaScript modules.
- **Improved Tree Shaking**: Better optimization during the build process.
- **Future-Proofing**: Ensuring compatibility with the evolving Node.js ecosystem.

## Key Changes

- Enabled ESM in the server application.
- Updated internal imports to include file extensions.
- Configured `.swcrc` to support NodeNext module resolution.
