Our CI/CD pipeline is now more modular and maintainable. We've split monolithic workflows into focused, reusable components. To complement this, we've introduced new automation tools:

- **`version-bump.ts`**: A script to automate Semantic Versioning updates.
- **`create-version-tag.ts`**: A utility for creating and pushing Git tags during releases.
- **`update-changelog.ts`**: Automated management of our project history.

## Automation Benefits

- **Consistent Versioning**: Automated bumps based on commit messages.
- **Release Clarity**: Tags and changelogs are always in sync with the codebase.
- **Maintainer Efficiency**: Less manual work for each release.
