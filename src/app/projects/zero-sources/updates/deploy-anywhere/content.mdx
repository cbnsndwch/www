        'Natively support ARM architecture for Apple Silicon and Graviton instances, plus self-hosted documentation support.',

};

To ensure our platform is accessible everywhere, we've significantly enhanced our deployment strategy.

- **Multi-Arch Docker:** Our builds now natively support **ARM architecture**, making local development on Apple Silicon and deployment on graviton-based cloud instances seamless.
- **Self-Hosted Docs:** We added a standalone version of our documentation app that can be hosted anywhere, breaking the dependency on Vercel for internal or private deployments.
