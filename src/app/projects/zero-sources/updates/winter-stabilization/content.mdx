We're ending the year on a high note! We have officially released the first set of core packages. Along with this, we've modernized our data layer by upgrading to MongoDB v7 and Mongoose v9. This brings better performance and more robust type safety, especially for the `StreamerShard` entity which now features enhanced type definitions.

### Key Highlights

- **First Public Releases:** Core libraries are now tagged and ready.
- **Data Layer Modernization:** Full support for MongoDB v7 and Mongoose v9.
- **Type Safety:** Improved internal entity definitions for better developer experience.
