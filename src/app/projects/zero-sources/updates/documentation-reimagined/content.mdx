Learning by doing is the best way to understand complex systems. We've introduced a brand new **Interactive Examples** page where you can see live code demos in action.

Our documentation has been completely restructured using **Fumadocs**, featuring:

- **Live Code Tabs:** Switch between code and results instantly.
- **Deep API Reference:** Automatically generated from our source code using Microsoft API Extractor.
- **Architecture Guides:** New deep-dives into "Change Sources" and "Watermark Strategies."
