};

We've just completed a massive infrastructure upgrade! The entire project has been migrated to the latest and greatest frontend and backend frameworks:

- **React 19 & React Router 7:** Powering our primary documentation and demo applications.
- **NestJS 11:** Providing a robust foundation for our server-side tools and APIs.
- **Vite 7:** Ensuring blazing-fast build times and a modern development workflow.

We also transitioned the entire codebase to **ESLint v9 Flat Config**, ensuring strict and consistent code quality across all workspaces.
