Today marks a significant milestone as we release the first version of **Zero Sources**. 

After months of internal development and testing, we're finally ready to share this tool with the community. Our goal is to make open-source maintenance less of a chore and more of a joy.

In this release, you'll find:
- Core automation engine for documentation.
- Support for GitHub Actions.
- Basic asset optimization.

Check out the [getting started guide](/projects/zero-sources) to begin using it today!
