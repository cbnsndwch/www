We are thrilled to announce the official launch of **Remix Tagged Templates**. This fork marks a significant shift in the project's direction, specifically tailored for the upcoming **Remix v3**.

The headline feature of version `0.4.x` is the native support for **bare `html` tagged templates**. You no longer need to prefix your templates with comments like `/* html */` to get syntax highlighting. If you use `html``` in your Remix projects, it just works!

Alongside this, we've refreshed the project's branding with a brand-new icon as we move towards a more focused developer experience.
