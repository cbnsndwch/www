While we are excited about our new direction, we wouldn't be here without the incredible foundation laid by **Matt Bierner** and the contributors to the original `comment-tagged-templates` project.

Over the years, this tool has grown through the contributions of many:

- **0.3.3:** Added support for Cypher, EdgeQL, and AppleScript (thanks to @fabiankaestner, @MrFoxPro, and @flops).
- **0.3.2:** Enabled SPARQL highlighting (thanks @Peeja).
- **0.3.1:** Brought JSX in Markdown and MJML support (thanks @homerjam and @frontendwizard).
- **Early Releases:** Established the core logic for efficient comment-based matching that developers have relied on since 2018.

As we move forward into the Remix v3 era, we carry this spirit of community-driven innovation with us.
