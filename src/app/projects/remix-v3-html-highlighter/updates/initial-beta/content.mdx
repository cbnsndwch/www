        'The journey begins with more efficient matching rules and template substitution fixes.'
};

From the very first release in 2018 that introduced more efficient matching rules and template substitution fixes, this project has been about making the developer experience better. Whether you are using the old comment-style tags or the new bare HTML tags, our goal remains the same: making your code beautiful and readable.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to track the Remix v3 roadmap!
