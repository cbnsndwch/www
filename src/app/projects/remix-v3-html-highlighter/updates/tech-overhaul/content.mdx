};

To ensure the project remains maintainable and lightning-fast for years to come, we've recently completed a massive infrastructure overhaul. 

- **Modern Tooling:** We've switched from npm to **pnpm** for faster, more reliable dependency management.
- **ESM Migration:** The entire codebase and test suite have been migrated to **ESM (ECMAScript Modules)**.
- **Automated Releases:** We've implemented **Changesets** and **GitHub Actions** to automate our release workflow, ensuring that new features and fixes reach you faster than ever.
- **CI/CD Cleanup:** We've retired old Travis CI configurations in favor of modern GitHub-native workflows.
