};

As part of our evolution into a Remix-centric tool, we've made the strategic decision to streamline the extension. 

We've removed support for miscellaneous embedded languages like SQL, GraphQL, Markdown, CSS, and XML. By focusing strictly on **HTML highlighting**, we can provide a much more stable and performant experience for the primary use case: building modern web interfaces with Remix. This lean approach reduces the extension's footprint and minimizes potential grammar conflicts in your editor.
