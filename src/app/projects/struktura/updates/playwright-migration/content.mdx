};

Reliability is non-negotiable. We've completed a major migration of our End-to-End (E2E) testing infrastructure to use **Vitest Browser Mode** with **Playwright**.

**Why the change?**
Previously, some component tests relied on mocking internal router hooks, which led to fragile tests that didn't reflect real user behavior. By shifting to a true browser-based approach, we solved 37 failing tests and gained significant confidence in our release pipeline.

**The New Setup:**
- **Real Browser Testing:** Tests run in Chromium via Playwright, simulating actual user interactions.
- **No More Mocking Routers:** We test the app exactly as it runs in production.
- **Enhanced DX:** Developers can now use the Vitest UI to watch tests run in real-time.

This migration ensures that when all checks pass, the application really works for our users.
