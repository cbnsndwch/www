};

We are excited to announce the initial release of **Struktura**, a sophisticated no-code data management platform built with modern web technologies.

From day one, we've prioritized a robust developer experience and scalability. We've adopted a modular monolith architecture, ensuring that as our application grows, our code remains organized and maintainable.

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- **Monorepo:** Managed with [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) and [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for efficient build pipelines and release management.
- **pnpm Workspaces:** Utilizing `ignoredBuiltDependencies` and `onlyBuiltDependencies` for optimized dependency handling.
- **TypeScript First:** Strict type safety across the entire stack, from frontend interactions to backend contracts.
- **Feature-Based Architecture:** Code is organized by domain (e.g., Auth, Collections) rather than technical layer, promoting clearer boundaries and easier refactoring.

This foundation sets the stage for rapid feature development and a stable, high-performance platform.
