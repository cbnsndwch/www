The difference between good and great software often lies in the details. Our latest updates focus on those finishing touches:

- **Keyboard Navigation:** Power users can now navigate the Data Grid entirely using the keyboard, improving accessibility and speed.
- **Toast Notifications:** A new notification system keeps users informed about the success or failure of their actions.
- **Safety First:** We've added robust `AlertDialog` confirmations for destructive actions like deleting records.

We are continuously refining interactions to make Struktura not just functional, but delightful to use.
