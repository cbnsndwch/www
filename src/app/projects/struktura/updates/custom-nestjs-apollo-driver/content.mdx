};

Performance and flexibility are critical for our GraphQL API. To meet our specific requirements, we've refactored our backend to use a custom **NestJS Apollo Driver**.

Standard adapters are great, but sometimes you need more control. By implementing a custom driver in `libs/nest-apollo`, we've gained:
- Finer control over the Apollo Server instance.
- Better integration with our specific NestJS dependency injection needs.
- Streamlined configuration for our modular architecture.

This update represents our commitment to "peeling back the layers" when necessary to deliver the best possible engineering solutions.
