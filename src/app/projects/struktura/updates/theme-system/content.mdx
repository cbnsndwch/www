};

User experience is at the heart of Struktura. We've introduced a comprehensive **Theme System** that goes beyond simple light and dark modes.

Built on top of `shadcn/ui` and using the modern OKLCH color space, our new theming engine offers:

- **System Compatibility:** Automatically respects your operating system's color preferences.
- **Smooth Transitions:** Seamless 0.3s CSS transitions when switching themes.
- **No Flash of Wrong Theme:** SSR-safe implementation ensures the correct theme is applied before the page renders.
- **Persistence:** Remembers your preference across sessions.

This system provides the visual foundation for all future UI components, ensuring consistency and accessibility throughout the application.
