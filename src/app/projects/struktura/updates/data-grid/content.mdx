};

Data is the lifeblood of Struktura, and how you interact with it matters. We've rolled out our new **Data Grid** component, capable of handling complex collection views.

**New Capabilities:**
- **Record Management:** Create, read, update, and delete records seamlessly.
- **Bulk Operations:** Optimized logic for handling multiple record updates.
- **Validation:** Integrated DTO validation prevents bad data from ever reaching the database.
- **Cell Editors:** Specialized editors like the new Date Picker ensure data integrity.

This grid is the central interface for users to manage their structured data, and it's built to be fast, responsive, and intuitive.
