Under the hood, we've upgraded our server implementation to **NestJS v11**. This brings better performance, improved typing, and access to the latest NestJS features.

Alongside this, we've fully embraced **ESM (ECMAScript Modules)** across the monorepo. This modernization ensures better tree-shaking and compatibility with the broader JavaScript ecosystem moving forward.
