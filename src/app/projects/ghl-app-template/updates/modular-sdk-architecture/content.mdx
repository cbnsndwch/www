We are thrilled to announce a complete overhaul of the HighLevel SDK! We've moved from a monolithic structure to a fully modular architecture. This gives you the flexibility to install only what you need, significantly reducing your application's bundle size.

## Key Highlights

- **Drastic Bundle Reduction**: The API-only client is now 68% smaller (~800KB).
- **Zero Forced Dependencies**: No more installing MongoDB or Express unless you actually use them.
- **Platform Agnostic**: Runs perfectly in Node.js, browsers, Deno, and Edge runtimes like Cloudflare Workers.

## New Packages

- `@cbnsndwch/ghl-sdk-core`: The heart of the API.
- `@cbnsndwch/ghl-sdk-storage`: Clean interfaces for your session data.
- `sdk-storage-memory` & `sdk-storage-mongodb`: Ready-to-go adapters.
- `@cbnsndwch/ghl-sdk-webhooks`: Framework-agnostic webhook management.
