Hello World! Today marks the birth of the `ghl-app-template`. Our mission is simple: provide a professional, scalable, and well-architected starting point for developers building on the HighLevel platform.

We're starting with a solid NestJS + TypeScript foundation, clear folder structures, and the beginnings of a dedicated SDK to make GHL development a breeze. Stay tuned as we build more!
