We've just updated our project headers to make it easier for the community to support our continued development! You'll now find "Buy Me a Coffee" links and updated GitHub Sponsor badges on the repository README.

Your support helps us maintain these tools, keep up with GHL API changes, and provide high-quality templates for everyone. If this project has saved you time, consider fueling our next coding session!
