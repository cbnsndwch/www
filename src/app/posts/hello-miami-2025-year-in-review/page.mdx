Reflecting on 2025, it's amazing to see what consistency and a focus on grassroots community building can achieve. We set out to create a regular space for builders in Miami, and the results have exceeded our expectations.

We hosted **75 Hack Night events** throughout the year. We're pretty picky about our approvals to ensure a high-quality environment for builders, yet we still approved **3,103 registrations**. Most importantly, we saw **315 unique builders** join us, with a massive number of them becoming regular attendees.

## The Community

The second half of the year—specifically July, September, and October—saw incredible energy. The diversity of roles has been fascinating. While Software Engineers make up the bulk of our attendees, we've seen a strong showing from startup founders, designers, hardware/electrical engineers, investors, and product managers.

        Engineers lead the pack, but Founders, Designers, and Investors are well

It hasn't just been senior folks or just students; it's a healthy mix. We've successfully created an environment where seasoned industry veterans share the space with newcomers, fostering mentorship and collaboration naturally.

## What's Next

The data is clear: the appetite for a mature technical scene in Miami is not just a hype cycle—it's real and it's growing. Our builders have spoken about what they want to see next. Beyond more Hack Nights, there is a strong demand for deeper technical engagement: hackathons, intimate dinners with local engineers, exclusive technical events, demo nights, and expert-led workshops.

        The community wants more: Hackathon, Dinners, and Technical Workshops
        top the list.

## Beyond Miami

While the core of our community hails from the Miami-Ft. Lauderdale-West Palm metro area, Hack Night has become a destination. We frequently host builders visiting from major tech hubs like New York and New Jersey, California, and a surprisingly strong contingent from the Midwest.

        While locally rooted, we attract builders from NY, CA, and across the
        globe.

## Looking Ahead

If you're reading this from a colder climate (looking at you, NYC and SF) and dreading the rest of winter, consider this your invitation. Our doors are open. If you're coming down to Miami, DM us—we'd love to have you join us or even speak at a future Hack Night.
